# clinicalETL
This project enables the use of clinical patient and event data for research purposes at the University Hospital Magdeburg. It enables a complete ETL process, starting from reading CSV data to selection, filtering, anonymization, and pseudonymization for strong patient confidentiality, ending with the loading of transformed and sanitized data into a separate PostgreSQL database.

Contained are scripts, source code and software configs created as part of my bachelor's thesis.
