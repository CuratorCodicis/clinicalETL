# clinicalETL
This project enables the use of clinical patient and event data for research purposes at the University Hospital Magdeburg. It enables a complete ETL process starting from reading csv data, to selection, filtering, anonymization & pseudonymization for strong patient confidentiality and completing the loading of transformed and sanatized data into a seperate PostgreSQL database. 

Contained are scripts, source code and software configs created as part of my bachelor's thesis.
